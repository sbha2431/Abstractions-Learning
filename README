List of the files:

digraph.py: Generates a graph object for use in MDP class. Contains graph methods such as computing strongly connected components, and sub-graphs etc.

mdp.py: Includes functions to construct non-deterministic finite automaton, sample next transition in a MDP, and computing best action in a state.

robot_grid.py: Generates the abstract MDP from discretizing the dynamics and implements the q-learning with different shields. The shield we used in the experiments require installation of a tool named SLUGS. You can find a link to that tool here: https://github.com/VerifiableRobotics/slugs

In this file, we have a similar shield that is generated by slugs to make sure that it runs without installing the tool.
